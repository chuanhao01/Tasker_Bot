# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

-   Finished the (draft) basic wireframes and justifications for both data viewer and result viewer
-   Research on unit testing libraries
-   Database schema
-   Set up ElephantSQL
-   Started on algorithms for the problem as well as draft charts using gantt-elastic, Vue and chartjs 

## What do I plan to do next week

-   Start on the actual codes for the project
-   

## Additional Thoughts

-   Might not be using gantt-elastic, Vue and Chartjs for the implementation of the frontend design due to a bug
-
