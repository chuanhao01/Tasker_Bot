# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

-   Finished the (draft) basic wireframes and justifications for both data viewer and result viewer
-   Research on unit testing libraries
-   Database schema
-   Set up ElephantSQL
-   Started on algorithms for the problem as well as draft charts using gantt-elastic, Vue and chartjs 

## What do I plan to do next week

-   Unit testing for frontend and backend
-   Problem Worksheet & Coding Style worksheet
-   API documentation
-   Get started on Basic insert API & Basic Data Viewer

## Additional Thoughts (Questions)

-   Check DB model and design
-   For bulk insert, only referring to tasks?
-   We give the taskID? or can we generate? or is it optional? Prefer generate..
-   Datetime instead of date and time?
-   Do we need a linter?
-   Acronym case?
-   JSdocs style and formation of documentation at the end
-   Difference of basic and advanced wireframe / justification -> both Basic and Advanced seems like it should be the same
-   Input computation for Result Viewer? Is it to add in new tasks?
-   Project planning worksheet -> Github issues & tasks?
