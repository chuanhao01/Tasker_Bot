#### Bad Points

1. Date ticks are too far apart and inconsistent
2. May be difficult to implement the stacked horizontal bars depending on library used 
3. No fields for input computation

### Justification 2

2. Timeline can also be adjusted to show daily, weekly, monthly, etc views
3. Able to show the members in the project 

#### Bad Points

1. No input computation fields
2. Dotted line showing current date on the timeline may be difficult to implement and automate correctly

### Justification 3

#### Good Points

1. Timeline is neat and consistent
2. Able to show multiple sub-tasks as well as the duration of the overarching task
